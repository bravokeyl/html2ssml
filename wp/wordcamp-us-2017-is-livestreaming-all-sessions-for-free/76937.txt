WordCamp US is kicking off this morning. If you couldn’t make the journey to
Nashville, you can still follow along at home or wherever you are in the world. 
Livestream Tickets are free on the event’s website. Once you’ve registered for a
ticket, head on over to 2017.us.wordcamp.org/live-stream/ and you’ll be able to
tune in to the Fiddle Track, Banjo Track, Guitar Track, and the State of the
Word (scheduled for Saturday, December 2, at 4PM CST).

WordCamp US will be running three tracks simultaneously for both days of the
conference and all sessions will be livestreamed. Check out the schedule to find
sessions you want to attend from home. Volunteers will also include captions,
which will be embedded within the live stream video. If you have any problems
with the stream, the event has a page dedicated to livestream attendees with a
backup stream, as well as a troubleshooting page for livestream support.

If you’re following along on Twitter, the WCUS Twitter volunteers will be
providing threaded coverage of sessions. This should keep your Twitter stream a
little tidier with a kickoff tweet for each session, followed by live coverage
threaded under each as replies.

Want to follow along with WCUS coverage at home? It will be easy by following
our threaded coverage. Each session will start with a tweet that looks like
this, All coverage of that session will be threaded to that kick-off tweet.
